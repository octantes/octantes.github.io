[arch-hud](https://github.com/octantes/arch-hud) is a personal build of [suckless](https://suckless.org/) tools for daily use on Arch Linux.

Built around the concept of a *heads-up display*, trying to make the computer feel like a tool again and not a cognitive black hole.
Implements a few minimal patches (listed below) with a low tech feel based around an 8bit palette and pixel fonts.

No gaps, no transparency, no compositor, **no distractions**. Do add [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) if you experience screen tearing.

To install just go into each directory and sudo make clean install (script pending).
